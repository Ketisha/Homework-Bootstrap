            <p> a handful of small ways, for many of us, life during quarantine is… kind of nice. We’re rekindling old
                friendships, adopting new pets, eating cake for breakfast. We don’t have commutes anymore. There are no
                unwanted plans to halfheartedly show up for.
                If you feel a little squeamish about acknowledging that fact, I don’t blame you. Right now, for a lot of
                people, the dominant emotions are grief and fear. Experiencing anything else feels dissonant, almost
                antisocial: You worry that others might disapprove or be angry with you if they find out you’re actually

            <p> A few days back, Brave browser raised $35mn in less than 30 seconds through an ICO (Initial Coin
                Offering) to build the advertising platform of the future that would trade attention using Blockchain.
                This one news is deeper than what it seem to be from the surface. With this post, I hope to break the
                answers to the above questions down to a level so that anyone with basic understanding of Internet can
                comprehend them. I run a newsletter called, Unmade, where I talk about the ideas of the future. To
                curate it, I’ve to read, research and question a lot of things. And this blog post is the nectar of my
