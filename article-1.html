            <p> a handful of small ways, for many of us, life during quarantine is… kind of nice. We’re rekindling old
                friendships, adopting new pets, eating cake for breakfast. We don’t have commutes anymore. There are no
                unwanted plans to halfheartedly show up for.
                If you feel a little squeamish about acknowledging that fact, I don’t blame you. Right now, for a lot of
                people, the dominant emotions are grief and fear. Experiencing anything else feels dissonant, almost
                antisocial: You worry that others might disapprove or be angry with you if they find out you’re actually
                feeling pretty content on your couch all day. And it’s uncomfortable when the world reveals how deeply
                unfair it can be...</p>
            <p>If you feel a little squeamish about acknowledging that fact, I don’t blame you. Right now, for a lot of
                people, the dominant emotions are grief and fear. Experiencing anything else feels dissonant, almost
                antisocial: You worry that others might disapprove or be angry with you if they find out you’re actually
                feeling pretty content on your couch all day. And it’s uncomfortable when the world reveals how deeply
                unfair it can be.</p>
            <p>But I’m here to tell you: It’s okay to enjoy your life right now. It’s more than okay. We’re all looking
                for bright spots; it’s a gift to find some that truly bring you joy. Minimizing your positive emotions
                doesn’t make you a more compassionate human or a resource to a world on fire.</p>
            <p>As a therapist, I often talk with my clients about what it means to have a mature emotional response to a
                situation. In this case, it means accepting that not everyone will mirror your emotions, or even be
                pleased with them — and that you have a right to them anyway. You don’t have to shout your joy from the
                rooftop as ambulances pass by, or flood everyone’s Instagram feed with posts about how much fun you’re
                having with your new quarantine hobbies, but you can be honest about how you’re doing when people ask.
                You can share moments of happiness with those closest to you, and let them know that you’re at least one
                person they don’t have to worry about.</p>
            <h3> Let your guilt guide you </h3>
            <p>Guilt can be a useful emotion: It highlights mistakes we’ve made or opportunities to serve others. If you
                feel guilty that your colleague is a single parent with three kids to homeschool, then maybe that’s an
                opportunity for you to step up and take a few things off their plate. If you feel guilty that you’re in
                relatively good health, maybe you could go to the grocery store for your elderly neighbor.</p>
            <p>Guilt isn’t useful, however, when it comes to events you can’t control. Here are some questions you can
                ask yourself:</p>
            <ul id="special">
                <li>Does my guilt indicate I’ve made a mistake?</li>
                <li>Is my guilt directing me to do something concrete?</li>
            </ul>
            <p> Any emotion can be useful if you also make space for your best thinking. And right now, the world needs
                our best thinking more than ever.</p>
