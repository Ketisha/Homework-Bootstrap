            <p>Afew days back, Brave browser raised $35mn in less than 30 seconds through an ICO (Initial Coin Offering)
                to build the advertising platform of the future that would trade attention using Blockchain. This one
                news is deeper than what it seem to be from the surface.
                Initial Coin Offering — what is that?
                Advertising platform of the future — what’s wrong with the current ones?
                Trade attention using Blockchain — what exactly again?!
                With this post, I hope to break the answers to the above questions down to a level so that anyone with
                basic understanding of Internet can comprehend them. I run a newsletter called, Unmade, where I talk
                about the ideas of the future. To curate it, I’ve to read, research and question a lot of things. And
                this blog post is the nectar of my research on Blockchain, Tokens and the Attention.</p>
            <h3>What is a Blockchain?</h3>
            <p>When I first came across this term, I guessed it to be some “chain of blocks.” I wasn’t too far. It
                indeed is a chain of blocks. The only thing to understand now is, what is a block.
                A block is a group of transactions that are held in chronological order and publically.
                Thanks to Richard Bradley of Deloitte, we’ve got a plain English explanation of Blockchain that even the
                non-geeks can comprehend.</p>

            <p>When blockchain was introduced first, it was presented as a protocol for a new currency infamously known
                as, Bitcoin. It took nearly four years for Bitcoin to gain popularity among the commons. And then it
                took another four years to get the financial infrastructure for a protocol like Blockchain to work. It’s
                only a matter of time that more applications get built on top of the blockchain protocol.
                Some people believe it to be a new internet and then, some individuals think of blockchain more like
                Linux. Predictive analogies are always flawed and only time will reveal what use cases humans can think
                of on top of Blockchains. Irrespective of what it turns out to be, new kind of applications is coming.
                The ones that are not centrally controlled by an individual or a single organization. Ones that will
                never suffer a downtime. Ones that has potential to question the fundamental assumptions of our
                economies.
                Whenever we are handed a ten-dollar bill, we appreciate its value. However, its worth is only assumed
                through the stories that we tell each other — in our imaginations. If we all start believing in another
                currency — that is distributed, decentralized and always available — the dollar has no hope of survival.
                If you and I are happy transacting using a new currency, no law can make it mandatory to use a currency
                that is regulated by them. Note that, laws are also the figment of our imagination.</p>
